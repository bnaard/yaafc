# YAAFC Yet another absurd file commander - Project Planning

## Project Overview

This project implements a Norton Commande-like file commander in the web using reflex.dev framework. The goal is to provide a user-friendly interface for managing files and directories, similar to the classic Norton Commander.
The project is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for easy addition of new features and tools.
It is meant as a tool to be installed on a local computer or a server to manage files and directories. of that computer or server.

## Architecture

- **Backend and Frontend Framework**: Managed by reflex.dev
- **Database**: using the built-in database of reflex.dev
- **File Management**: Uses the built-in file management capabilities of python pathlib

## AI Assistant Context

### Webpages to fetch

Always fetch and read the following webpages before starting a new task:

- [Reflex Documentation](https://reflex.dev/docs/getting-started/introduction/)
- [Polars Documentation](https://docs.pola.rs/)
- [Radix UI Colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors)

## Reflex Guidelines

- Create new reflex-based components for this project always in the `yaafc/ui` directory
- When creating a component, as much as possible use the following blueprint:

```python
class Table(rx.ComponentState):
    @classmethod
    def create(cls, *children, **props) -> rx.Component:
        return rx.component(
            cls,
            *children,
            **props,
        )

table = Table.create
```

- when using a component created in this project, always use the following blueprint:

```python
import yaafc.ui as ui

table = ui.table()
```

- Use Reflex state for all app state.
- Use Chakra UI components for layout and forms.
- Add docstrings to all public functions.
- Only comment on complex business logic.
- Sanitize all user inputs.
- Lazy-load images and large components.
- Never expose stack traces in error messages.

## Markup and Tailwind CSS Guidelines

### Keep Markup Simple

- Aim for a maximum nesting depth of 3-4 levels
- Avoid excessive conditional rendering that creates multiple levels of nesting
- Use sensible defaults for CSS with minimal override complexity

### Tailwind Best Practices

- Use Tailwind's utility classes directly in HTML/JSX for most styling
- Extract reusable patterns to components rather than creating custom classes
- For complex components, consider grouping Tailwind classes with template literals
- Utilize Tailwind's `@apply` directive sparingly and only for highly reused patterns
- Create consistent spacing, color and typography systems through Tailwind configuration

## Code Elegance Guidelines

### Simplicity Principles

- Functions should generally be under 20 lines
- Components should generally be under 150 lines
- Aim for component props to be under 7 items
- Use destructuring for cleaner component interfaces
- Group related state items in meaningful objects
- Follow the principle of least knowledge (components only know what they need)
- Use `isort` to sort imports
- Use `ruff` to format code
- Use `mypy` for type checking
- Always order contents of `__all__` alphabetically

## Implementation Instructions

- **Always read all the following listed project requirements documents** before starting a new task and check the requirements in this file. Implement all requirements in this file in the order of priority. When finished with one requirement, set it's status to "Completed" and add the date of completion. If a requirement is not relevant anymore, set it's status to "Not relevant" and add the date of this decision.
